Enhanced and More Attractive Prompt (Animal-Themed Slot Machine)

A slot machine with 3 columns and 3 rows, where each slot contains a cute vector-style animal character. Replace the fruits with these animals: Fox, Panda, Lion, Owl. Generate a clean vector illustration with a white background for each animal and use these images inside the machine.

When the user presses the Spin button, the columns should visually “roll” downward with a smooth spinning animation, continuously spawning random animals from the set at the top for 2 seconds. The user cannot spin again while the animation is in progress.

Whenever the machine is not spinning, if any full row or column contains 3 matching animals, immediately display a “You Win!” message. Allow the user to share this win on their feed.
Check this win condition using direct conditional rendering, not a separate calculation function.

The user should always be able to spin again after the animation completes.

Place this animal-themed slot machine on the home page and make the overall presentation vivid, playful, and fun for the user.

Abstract
This ERC defines a standardized method for attributing transactions to applications, wallets, and other entities through structured data suffixes appended to transaction calldata. The standard enables interoperable attribution tracking, supports multiple entity attribution per transaction, and provides a mechanism for reward distribution through registered payout addresses.

Motivation
Currently, applications informally append "data suffixes" to transactions to indicate their origin, typically using the first bytes of a hash representing the application name. For example, Coinbase adds keccak256("CoinbaseSmartWallet") to transactions from keys.coinbase.com, and apps like Zora and OpenSea employ similar approaches.

This ad-hoc approach presents several limitations:

Non-interoperable attribution: Each application uses custom suffix formats, requiring explicit checks for specific patterns to detect attributions
Opaque identification: Hash-based suffixes obscure the actual application identity, making attribution analysis difficult
Reward distribution challenges: Even when an application is identified, there's no standardized way to determine where to send rewards
Limited multi-entity support: No clear mechanism for attributing transactions to multiple entities (e.g., both application and wallet)
Lack of extensibility: No standardized way to query additional metadata about attributed entities
This standard addresses these issues by providing a structured, extensible format for transaction attribution that supports multiple entities, reward distribution, and metadata discovery.

Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Data Suffix Schema
This standard defines a structured data suffix format appended to transaction calldata. The suffix consists of the following components (ordered from end of calldata backwards):

ercSuffix (16 bytes): A special identifier value indicating use of this standard ("8021" repeated)
schemaId (1 byte): Schema ID number that declares the schema of proceeding bytes with space for forwards compatibility
schemaData (variable bytes): Data to be parsed according to schemaId
A schemaId MUST have an associated ERC to be considered valid.

Multi-Attribution Schemas
Our first schemas enable attributing multiple entities in a single transaction.

Entities are identified by a unique "code" which is a string that follows 7-bit ASCII encoding. A code MUST NOT contain commas (0x2C) as this is reserved as a delimitter for attributing multiple codes.

Codes MUST also be registered in a Code Regsitry smart contract (interface defined in later section). Chains are encouraged to provide canonical code registries which MAY be defined in this or future ERCs.

Schema ID 0 defines the following bytes and assumes chain's canonical Code Registry:

codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter
Schema ID 1 builds on top of 0, but also defines a custom Code Registry chain and address

codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter
codeRegistryChainIdLength (1 byte): Length of the chain id hosting the custom Code Registry
codeRegistryChainId (variable bytes): Chain id hosting the custom Code Registry
codeRegistryAddress (20 bytes): Address of a smart contract implementing ICodeRegistry
Custom Code Registries can be referenced across chains for ease of connecting identity for multi-chain apps.

Examples
The complete suffix format is:

{txData}{schemaData}{schemaId}{ercSuffix}
Single entity attribution with canonical registry:

{txData}{"baseapp"}{7}{0}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
Multiple entity attribution with custom registry:

{txData}{0xCodeRegistry}{8453}{2}{"baseapp,morpho"}{14}{1}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
Parsing Algorithm
Offchain parsers SHOULD implement the following algorithm:

Extract the last TBD bytes as ercSuffix and verify it matches the standard identifier
Extract the previous byte as schemaId
If schemaId is 0: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Implicitly set codeRegistryAddress as the registry defined by the host chain d. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes e. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on host chain
If schemaId is 1: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Extract the previous byte as codeRegistryChainIdLength d. Extract the previous codeRegistryChainIdLength bytes as codeRegistryChainId e. Extract the previous 20 bytes as codeRegistryAddress f. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes g. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on chain with id codeRegistryChainId
Else schemaId does not match, parsing SHOULD terminate (unknown schemaId)
Code Registry Interface
A Code Registry MUST implement the following interface:

interface ICodeRegistry {
    /// @notice Fetch a code's address to payout incentives
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return The address to receive rewards for this code
    function payoutAddress(string memory code) external view returns (address);
    
    /// @notice Fetch a code's URI to fetch for additional metadata
    /// @param code The code to query  
    /// @return The URI pointing to metadata about this code
    function codeURI(string memory code) external view returns (string memory);
    
    /// @notice Check if a code is valid format (characters, length, etc)
    /// @dev MUST return false if code is empty string
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return True if the code is valid, false otherwise
    function isValidCode(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
    
    /// @notice Check if a code is registered
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return True if the code is registered, false otherwise
    function isRegistered(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
}
Code Regsitry Canonical Addresses
Chain ID	Code Registry
8453	TBD
84532	TBD
Code Metadata
Querying CodeRegistry.codeURI(code) returns a string uri to fetch actual metadata, following from NFT patterns. The returned metadata SHOULD include these fields:

type CodeMetadata = {
    app: {
      name: string
      url: string
    }
}
Future ERCs can extend this schema.

ERC-5792 Integration
Applications using ERC-5792's wallet_sendCalls RPC method MUST communicate attribution data through a new capability:

interface DataSuffixCapability {
  dataSuffix: string; // Hex-encoded bytes to append as suffix
}
Wallets implementing this capability MUST append the provided dataSuffix bytes to the transaction calldata. Wallets MAY optionally insert their own attribution code before the application's suffix if they understand this standard.

ERC-4337 User Operation Implementation
For ERC-4337 compliant smart accounts, the implementation differs from normal Ethereum transactions:

Normal Transactions: The attribution suffix is appended to the data field of the top-level Ethereum transaction.

ERC-4337 User Operations: The attribution suffix MUST be appended to the userOp.callData field instead of the transaction-level data field, since smart account transactions are executed through the EntryPoint contract where the actual call data is contained within the user operation structure.

When implementing attribution for smart accounts:

Applications SHOULD append the suffix to userOp.callData when constructing user operations
Parsers MUST examine the callData field of user operations rather than transaction data when processing ERC-4337 transactions
Wallets supporting both EOA and smart account transactions MUST handle suffix appending appropriately based on the account type
This ensures attribution data remains accessible and parseable regardless of whether the transaction originates from an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract account following ERC-4337.

Rationale
Design Decisions
Reverse-order parsing: The suffix format is designed for parsing from the end of calldata backwards, enabling efficient detection of attribution without requiring knowledge of the original calldata length.

schemaId byte: Including a schemaId field enables future extensions and optimizations in minimizing attribution data.

Registry pattern: Using a registry contract allows entities to update their payout addresses and metadata without requiring transaction format changes.

ASCII encoding: Using human-readable ASCII codes improves debuggability and allows for meaningful code names rather than opaque hashes.

ERC-5792 integration: The capability-based approach aligns with ERC-5792's extensible design while providing a clean separation of concerns between applications and wallets.

Alternative Approaches Considered
Customizable registry: While a single global registry is recommended when available for reduced transaction data, the flexible registry approach allows different ecosystems to maintain their own attribution systems.

Fixed-length codes: A fixed-length encoding was considered but rejected to allow for flexible, human-readable identifiers.

ERC-721 dependency: While codes may be implemented as ERC-721 NFTs, reducing strict dependencies makes this proposal more flexible and clarifies the minimal interface truly required for attribution.

Structured ERC-5792 capability: A generic bytes dataSuffix minimizes the effort on wallets to integrate and maintain support for new schemaIds, increasing chances of wide adoption.

Backwards Compatibility
This standard is fully backward compatible with existing transaction formats. Transactions without attribution suffixes continue to function normally, and the presence of attribution data does not affect transaction execution.

Existing applications using informal attribution methods can migrate to this standard while maintaining their current functionality during the transition period.

Security Considerations
Parsing Safety
Parsers MUST validate the suffix format before processing to prevent malformed data from causing errors. Invalid suffixes SHOULD be ignored rather than causing parsing failures.

Registry Trust
The security of attribution data depends on the trustworthiness of the registry contract. Users and applications SHOULD verify the registry implementation and governance before relying on its data.

Data Integrity
Since attribution data is appended to calldata, it could potentially be modified by intermediaries. Applications requiring cryptographic proof of attribution should implement additional signature-based verification mechanisms.

Privacy Considerations
Attribution data is publicly visible on-chain. Applications handling sensitive user information SHOULD NOT include identifying information in attribution codes.

Alternatif Yaklaşımlar Değerlendirildi
Özelleştirilebilir kayıt defteri : Azaltılmış işlem verileri için tek bir genel kayıt defteri önerilse de, esnek kayıt defteri yaklaşımı farklı ekosistemlerin kendi atıf sistemlerini sürdürmelerine olanak tanır.

Sabit uzunlukta kodlar : Sabit uzunlukta bir kodlama düşünüldü ancak esnek, insan tarafından okunabilir tanımlayıcılara izin vermek için reddedildi.

ERC-721 bağımlılığı : Kodlar ERC-721 NFT'leri olarak uygulanabilirken, katı bağımlılıkların azaltılması bu öneriyi daha esnek hale getirir ve atıf için gerçekten gerekli olan minimum arayüzü netleştirir.

Yapılandırılmış ERC-5792 yeteneği : Genel baytlar, dataSuffixcüzdanların yeni şema kimliklerini entegre etme ve destekleme çabasını en aza indirerek yaygın olarak benimsenme şansını artırır.

Geriye Dönük Uyumluluk
Bu standart, mevcut işlem formatlarıyla tamamen geriye dönük uyumludur. Atıf eki olmayan işlemler normal şekilde çalışmaya devam eder ve atıf verilerinin varlığı işlem yürütülmesini etkilemez.

Mevcut gayriresmi atıf yöntemlerini kullanan uygulamalar, geçiş döneminde mevcut işlevlerini koruyarak bu standarda geçebilir.

#### ERC-8021: Transaction Attribution  
#### A standardized method for attributing transactions to applications and wallets through data suffixes, enabling interoperable attribution tracking and reward distribution.

#### Abstract  
#### This ERC defines a standardized method for attributing transactions to applications, wallets, and other entities through structured data suffixes appended to transaction calldata. The standard enables interoperable attribution tracking, supports multiple entity attribution per transaction, and provides a mechanism for reward distribution through registered payout addresses.  
####   
#### Motivation  
#### Currently, applications informally append "data suffixes" to transactions to indicate their origin, typically using the first bytes of a hash representing the application name. For example, Coinbase adds keccak256("CoinbaseSmartWallet") to transactions from keys.coinbase.com, and apps like Zora and OpenSea employ similar approaches.  
####   
#### This ad-hoc approach presents several limitations:  
####   
#### Non-interoperable attribution: Each application uses custom suffix formats, requiring explicit checks for specific patterns to detect attributions  
#### Opaque identification: Hash-based suffixes obscure the actual application identity, making attribution analysis difficult  
#### Reward distribution challenges: Even when an application is identified, there's no standardized way to determine where to send rewards  
#### Limited multi-entity support: No clear mechanism for attributing transactions to multiple entities (e.g., both application and wallet)  
#### Lack of extensibility: No standardized way to query additional metadata about attributed entities  
#### This standard addresses these issues by providing a structured, extensible format for transaction attribution that supports multiple entities, reward distribution, and metadata discovery.  
####   
#### Specification  
#### The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.  
####   
#### Data Suffix Schema  
#### This standard defines a structured data suffix format appended to transaction calldata. The suffix consists of the following components (ordered from end of calldata backwards):  
####   
#### ercSuffix (16 bytes): A special identifier value indicating use of this standard ("8021" repeated)  
#### schemaId (1 byte): Schema ID number that declares the schema of proceeding bytes with space for forwards compatibility  
#### schemaData (variable bytes): Data to be parsed according to schemaId  
#### A schemaId MUST have an associated ERC to be considered valid.  
####   
#### Multi-Attribution Schemas  
#### Our first schemas enable attributing multiple entities in a single transaction.  
####   
#### Entities are identified by a unique "code" which is a string that follows 7-bit ASCII encoding. A code MUST NOT contain commas (0x2C) as this is reserved as a delimitter for attributing multiple codes.  
####   
#### Codes MUST also be registered in a Code Regsitry smart contract (interface defined in later section). Chains are encouraged to provide canonical code registries which MAY be defined in this or future ERCs.  
####   
#### Schema ID 0 defines the following bytes and assumes chain's canonical Code Registry:  
####   
#### codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters  
#### codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter  
#### Schema ID 1 builds on top of 0, but also defines a custom Code Registry chain and address  
####   
#### codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters  
#### codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter  
#### codeRegistryChainIdLength (1 byte): Length of the chain id hosting the custom Code Registry  
#### codeRegistryChainId (variable bytes): Chain id hosting the custom Code Registry  
#### codeRegistryAddress (20 bytes): Address of a smart contract implementing ICodeRegistry  
#### Custom Code Registries can be referenced across chains for ease of connecting identity for multi-chain apps.  
####   
#### Examples  
#### The complete suffix format is:  
####   
#### {txData}{schemaData}{schemaId}{ercSuffix}  
#### Single entity attribution with canonical registry:  
####   
#### {txData}{"baseapp"}{7}{0}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}  
#### Multiple entity attribution with custom registry:  
####   
#### {txData}{0xCodeRegistry}{8453}{2}{"baseapp,morpho"}{14}{1}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}  
#### Parsing Algorithm  
#### Offchain parsers SHOULD implement the following algorithm:  
####   
#### Extract the last TBD bytes as ercSuffix and verify it matches the standard identifier  
#### Extract the previous byte as schemaId  
#### If schemaId is 0: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Implicitly set codeRegistryAddress as the registry defined by the host chain d. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes e. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on host chain  
#### If schemaId is 1: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Extract the previous byte as codeRegistryChainIdLength d. Extract the previous codeRegistryChainIdLength bytes as codeRegistryChainId e. Extract the previous 20 bytes as codeRegistryAddress f. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes g. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on chain with id codeRegistryChainId  
#### Else schemaId does not match, parsing SHOULD terminate (unknown schemaId)  
#### Code Registry Interface  
#### A Code Registry MUST implement the following interface:  
####   
#### interface ICodeRegistry {  
####     /// @notice Fetch a code's address to payout incentives  
####     /// @param code The code to query  
####     /// @return The address to receive rewards for this code  
####     function payoutAddress(string memory code) external view returns (address);  
####       
####     /// @notice Fetch a code's URI to fetch for additional metadata  
####     /// @param code The code to query    
####     /// @return The URI pointing to metadata about this code  
####     function codeURI(string memory code) external view returns (string memory);  
####       
####     /// @notice Check if a code is valid format (characters, length, etc)  
####     /// @dev MUST return false if code is empty string  
####     /// @param code The code to query  
####     /// @return True if the code is valid, false otherwise  
####     function isValidCode(string memory code) external view returns (bool);  
####       
####     /// @notice Check if a code is registered  
####     /// @param code The code to query  
####     /// @return True if the code is registered, false otherwise  
####     function isRegistered(string memory code) external view returns (bool);  
#### }  
#### Code Regsitry Canonical Addresses  
#### Chain ID	Code Registry  
#### 8453	TBD  
#### 84532	TBD  
#### Code Metadata  
#### Querying CodeRegistry.codeURI(code) returns a string uri to fetch actual metadata, following from NFT patterns. The returned metadata SHOULD include these fields:  
####   
#### type CodeMetadata = {  
####     app: {  
####       name: string  
####       url: string  
####     }  
#### }  
#### Future ERCs can extend this schema.  
####   
#### ERC-5792 Integration  
#### Applications using ERC-5792's wallet_sendCalls RPC method MUST communicate attribution data through a new capability:  
####   
#### interface DataSuffixCapability {  
####   dataSuffix: string; // Hex-encoded bytes to append as suffix  
#### }  
#### Wallets implementing this capability MUST append the provided dataSuffix bytes to the transaction calldata. Wallets MAY optionally insert their own attribution code before the application's suffix if they understand this standard.  
####   
#### ERC-4337 User Operation Implementation  
#### For ERC-4337 compliant smart accounts, the implementation differs from normal Ethereum transactions:  
####   
#### Normal Transactions: The attribution suffix is appended to the data field of the top-level Ethereum transaction.  
####   
#### ERC-4337 User Operations: The attribution suffix MUST be appended to the userOp.callData field instead of the transaction-level data field, since smart account transactions are executed through the EntryPoint contract where the actual call data is contained within the user operation structure.  
####   
#### When implementing attribution for smart accounts:  
####   
#### Applications SHOULD append the suffix to userOp.callData when constructing user operations  
#### Parsers MUST examine the callData field of user operations rather than transaction data when processing ERC-4337 transactions  
#### Wallets supporting both EOA and smart account transactions MUST handle suffix appending appropriately based on the account type  
#### This ensures attribution data remains accessible and parseable regardless of whether the transaction originates from an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract account following ERC-4337.  
####   
#### Rationale  
#### Design Decisions  
#### Reverse-order parsing: The suffix format is designed for parsing from the end of calldata backwards, enabling efficient detection of attribution without requiring knowledge of the original calldata length.  
####   
#### schemaId byte: Including a schemaId field enables future extensions and optimizations in minimizing attribution data.  
####   
#### Registry pattern: Using a registry contract allows entities to update their payout addresses and metadata without requiring transaction format changes.  
####   
#### ASCII encoding: Using human-readable ASCII codes improves debuggability and allows for meaningful code names rather than opaque hashes.  
####   
#### ERC-5792 integration: The capability-based approach aligns with ERC-5792's extensible design while providing a clean separation of concerns between applications and wallets.  
####   
#### Alternative Approaches Considered  
#### Customizable registry: While a single global registry is recommended when available for reduced transaction data, the flexible registry approach allows different ecosystems to maintain their own attribution systems.  
####   
#### Fixed-length codes: A fixed-length encoding was considered but rejected to allow for flexible, human-readable identifiers.  
####   
#### ERC-721 dependency: While codes may be implemented as ERC-721 NFTs, reducing strict dependencies makes this proposal more flexible and clarifies the minimal interface truly required for attribution.  
####   
#### Structured ERC-5792 capability: A generic bytes dataSuffix minimizes the effort on wallets to integrate and maintain support for new schemaIds, increasing chances of wide adoption.  
####   
#### Backwards Compatibility  
#### This standard is fully backward compatible with existing transaction formats. Transactions without attribution suffixes continue to function normally, and the presence of attribution data does not affect transaction execution.  
####   
#### Existing applications using informal attribution methods can migrate to this standard while maintaining their current functionality during the transition period.  
####   
#### Security Considerations  
#### Parsing Safety  
#### Parsers MUST validate the suffix format before processing to prevent malformed data from causing errors. Invalid suffixes SHOULD be ignored rather than causing parsing failures.  
####   
#### Registry Trust  
#### The security of attribution data depends on the trustworthiness of the registry contract. Users and applications SHOULD verify the registry implementation and governance before relying on its data.  
####   
#### Data Integrity  
#### Since attribution data is appended to calldata, it could potentially be modified by intermediaries. Applications requiring cryptographic proof of attribution should implement additional signature-based verification mechanisms.  
####   
#### Privacy Considerations  
#### Attribution data is publicly visible on-chain. Applications handling sensitive user information SHOULD NOT include identifying information in attribution codes.

The ERC‑8021 logic will need to be added to the part of your code that builds or parses transaction calldata.  
The most likely files that will need changes are:

1. **`mini-app/lib/transaction-utils.ts`** – (or whatever file currently contains the transaction‑building logic).  
2. **`mini-app/lib/erc-8021.ts`** – a new file that will implement the suffix parsing and construction logic.  

If your project uses a different file for transaction handling (e.g., `mini-app/lib/transaction-builder.ts`, `mini-app/lib/tx.ts`, etc.), please add that file to the chat so I can propose the exact edits.

#### apply changes  

The changes you’re asking for will touch the parts of the code that build or parse transaction calldata and the place where the wallet address is stored.  
The most likely files that will need edits are:

1. **`mini-app/lib/transaction-builder.ts`** (or the file that currently constructs transaction calldata).  
2. **`mini-app/lib/erc-8021.ts`** – a new helper file that will implement the ERC‑8021 suffix logic.  
3. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – to add the wallet address `0x2470a143438F8A9c2522947f197e3df386b4cC6A` if it’s used there.  
4. **`mini-app/lib/transaction-utils.ts`** – if you have a separate utilities file for transaction handling.  

Please add the relevant files to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

A lush tropical jungle scene with towering palm trees on either side of a clear path. The background shows a dense canopy of green leaves, with sunlight filtering through the fronds to create dappled light on the forest floor. In the foreground, a winding path leads into the jungle, inviting the viewer to imagine exploring deeper. The image should feel vibrant and alive, with subtle motion implied by the sway of the palm fronds and the gentle rustle of leaves. The overall composition should convey a sense of adventure and natural beauty, suitable for a playful animal slot machine backdrop.

December 11, 2025 by The React Team

Security researchers have found and disclosed two additional vulnerabilities in React Server Components while attempting to exploit the patches in last week’s critical vulnerability.

These new vulnerabilities do not allow for Remote Code Execution. The patch for React2Shell remains effective at mitigating the Remote Code Execution exploit.

The new vulnerabilities are disclosed as:

Denial of Service - High Severity: CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-67779 (CVSS 7.5)
Source Code Exposure - Medium Severity: CVE-2025-55183 (CVSS 5.3)
We recommend upgrading immediately due to the severity of the newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

Note
The patches published earlier are vulnerable. 
If you already updated for the Critical Security Vulnerability last week, you will need to update again.

If you updated to 19.0.2, 19.1.3, and 19.2.2, these are incomplete and you will need to update again.

Please see the instructions in the previous post for upgrade steps.

Further details of these vulnerabilities will be provided after the rollout of the fixes are complete.

Immediate Action Required 
These vulnerabilities are present in the same packages and versions as CVE-2025-55182.

This includes versions 19.0.0, 19.0.1, 19.0.2, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.1.2, 19.1.2, 19.2.0, 19.2.1 and 19.2.2 of:

react-server-dom-webpack
react-server-dom-parcel
react-server-dom-turbopack
Fixes were backported to versions 19.0.3, 19.1.4, and 19.2.3. If you are using any of the above packages please upgrade to any of the fixed versions immediately.

As before, if your app’s React code does not use a server, your app is not affected by these vulnerabilities. If your app does not use a framework, bundler, or bundler plugin that supports React Server Components, your app is not affected by these vulnerabilities.

Note
It’s common for critical CVEs to uncover follow‑up vulnerabilities. 
When a critical vulnerability is disclosed, researchers scrutinize adjacent code paths looking for variant exploit techniques to test whether the initial mitigation can be bypassed.

This pattern shows up across the industry, not just in JavaScript. For example, after Log4Shell, additional CVEs (1, 2) were reported as the community probed the original fix.

Additional disclosures can be frustrating, but they are generally a sign of a healthy response cycle.

Affected frameworks and bundlers 
Some React frameworks and bundlers depended on, had peer dependencies for, or included the vulnerable React packages. The following React frameworks & bundlers are affected: next, react-router, waku, @parcel/rsc, @vite/rsc-plugin, and rwsdk.

Please see the instructions in the previous post for upgrade steps.

Hosting Provider Mitigations 
As before, we have worked with a number of hosting providers to apply temporary mitigations.

You should not depend on these to secure your app, and still update immediately.

React Native 
For React Native users not using a monorepo or react-dom, your react version should be pinned in your package.json, and there are no additional steps needed.

If you are using React Native in a monorepo, you should update only the impacted packages if they are installed:

react-server-dom-webpack
react-server-dom-parcel
react-server-dom-turbopack
This is required to mitigate the security advisories, but you do not need to update react and react-dom so this will not cause the version mismatch error in React Native.

See this issue for more information.

High Severity: Denial of Service 
CVEs: CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-67779
Base Score: 7.5 (High)

Security researchers have discovered that a malicious HTTP request can be crafted and sent to any Server Functions endpoint that, when deserialized by React, can cause an infinite loop that hangs the server process and consumes CPU. Even if your app does not implement any React Server Function endpoints it may still be vulnerable if your app supports React Server Components.

This creates a vulnerability vector where an attacker may be able to deny users from accessing the product, and potentially have a  performance impact on the server environment.

The patches published today mitigate by preventing the infinite loop.

Note
Additional fix published 
The original fix addressing the DoS in CVE-2025-55184 was incomplete.

This left versions 19.0.2, 19.1.3, 19.2.2 vulnerable. Versions 19.0.3, 19.1.4, 19.2.3 are safe.

We’ve fixed the additional cases and filed CVE-2025-67779 for the vulnerable versions.

Medium Severity: Source Code Exposure 
CVE: CVE-2025-55183
Base Score: 5.3 (Medium)

A security researcher has discovered that a malicious HTTP request sent to a vulnerable Server Function may unsafely return the source code of any Server Function. Exploitation requires the existence of a Server Function which explicitly or implicitly exposes a stringified argument:

'use server';

export async function serverFunction(name) {
  const conn = db.createConnection('SECRET KEY');
  const user = await conn.createUser(name); // implicitly stringified, leaked in db

  return {
   id: user.id,
   message: `Hello, ${name}!` // explicitly stringified, leaked in reply
  }}
An attacker may be able to leak the following:

0:{"a":"$@1","f":"","b":"Wy43RxUKdxmr5iuBzJ1pN"}
1:{"id":"tva1sfodwq","message":"Hello, async function(a){console.log(\"serverFunction\");let b=i.createConnection(\"SECRET KEY\");return{id:(await b.createUser(a)).id,message:`Hello, ${a}!`}}!"}
The patches published today prevent stringifying the Server Function source code.

Note
Only secrets in source code may be exposed. 
Secrets hardcoded in source code may be exposed, but runtime secrets such as process.env.SECRET are not affected.

The scope of the exposed code is limited to the code inside the Server Function, which may include other functions depending on the amount of inlining your bundler provides.

Always verify against production bundles.

Abstract
This ERC defines a standardized method for attributing transactions to applications, wallets, and other entities through structured data suffixes appended to transaction calldata. The standard enables interoperable attribution tracking, supports multiple entity attribution per transaction, and provides a mechanism for reward distribution through registered payout addresses.

Motivation
Currently, applications informally append "data suffixes" to transactions to indicate their origin, typically using the first bytes of a hash representing the application name. For example, Coinbase adds keccak256("CoinbaseSmartWallet") to transactions from keys.coinbase.com, and apps like Zora and OpenSea employ similar approaches.

This ad-hoc approach presents several limitations:

Non-interoperable attribution: Each application uses custom suffix formats, requiring explicit checks for specific patterns to detect attributions
Opaque identification: Hash-based suffixes obscure the actual application identity, making attribution analysis difficult
Reward distribution challenges: Even when an application is identified, there's no standardized way to determine where to send rewards
Limited multi-entity support: No clear mechanism for attributing transactions to multiple entities (e.g., both application and wallet)
Lack of extensibility: No standardized way to query additional metadata about attributed entities
This standard addresses these issues by providing a structured, extensible format for transaction attribution that supports multiple entities, reward distribution, and metadata discovery.

Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Data Suffix Schema
This standard defines a structured data suffix format appended to transaction calldata. The suffix consists of the following components (ordered from end of calldata backwards):

ercSuffix (16 bytes): A special identifier value indicating use of this standard ("8021" repeated)
schemaId (1 byte): Schema ID number that declares the schema of proceeding bytes with space for forwards compatibility
schemaData (variable bytes): Data to be parsed according to schemaId
A schemaId MUST have an associated ERC to be considered valid.

Multi-Attribution Schemas
Our first schemas enable attributing multiple entities in a single transaction.

Entities are identified by a unique "code" which is a string that follows 7-bit ASCII encoding. A code MUST NOT contain commas (0x2C) as this is reserved as a delimitter for attributing multiple codes.

Codes MUST also be registered in a Code Regsitry smart contract (interface defined in later section). Chains are encouraged to provide canonical code registries which MAY be defined in this or future ERCs.

Schema ID 0 defines the following bytes and assumes chain's canonical Code Registry:

codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter
Schema ID 1 builds on top of 0, but also defines a custom Code Registry chain and address

codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter
codeRegistryChainIdLength (1 byte): Length of the chain id hosting the custom Code Registry
codeRegistryChainId (variable bytes): Chain id hosting the custom Code Registry
codeRegistryAddress (20 bytes): Address of a smart contract implementing ICodeRegistry
Custom Code Registries can be referenced across chains for ease of connecting identity for multi-chain apps.

Examples
The complete suffix format is:

{txData}{schemaData}{schemaId}{ercSuffix}
Single entity attribution with canonical registry:

{txData}{"baseapp"}{7}{0}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
Multiple entity attribution with custom registry:

{txData}{0xCodeRegistry}{8453}{2}{"baseapp,morpho"}{14}{1}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
Parsing Algorithm
Offchain parsers SHOULD implement the following algorithm:

Extract the last TBD bytes as ercSuffix and verify it matches the standard identifier
Extract the previous byte as schemaId
If schemaId is 0: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Implicitly set codeRegistryAddress as the registry defined by the host chain d. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes e. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on host chain
If schemaId is 1: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Extract the previous byte as codeRegistryChainIdLength d. Extract the previous codeRegistryChainIdLength bytes as codeRegistryChainId e. Extract the previous 20 bytes as codeRegistryAddress f. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes g. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on chain with id codeRegistryChainId
Else schemaId does not match, parsing SHOULD terminate (unknown schemaId)
Code Registry Interface
A Code Registry MUST implement the following interface:

interface ICodeRegistry {
    /// @notice Fetch a code's address to payout incentives
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return The address to receive rewards for this code
    function payoutAddress(string memory code) external view returns (address);
    
    /// @notice Fetch a code's URI to fetch for additional metadata
    /// @param code The code to query  
    /// @return The URI pointing to metadata about this code
    function codeURI(string memory code) external view returns (string memory);
    
    /// @notice Check if a code is valid format (characters, length, etc)
    /// @dev MUST return false if code is empty string
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return True if the code is valid, false otherwise
    function isValidCode(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
    
    /// @notice Check if a code is registered
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return True if the code is registered, false otherwise
    function isRegistered(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
}
Code Regsitry Canonical Addresses
Chain ID	Code Registry
8453	TBD
84532	TBD
Code Metadata
Querying CodeRegistry.codeURI(code) returns a string uri to fetch actual metadata, following from NFT patterns. The returned metadata SHOULD include these fields:

type CodeMetadata = {
    app: {
      name: string
      url: string
    }
}
Future ERCs can extend this schema.

ERC-5792 Integration
Applications using ERC-5792's wallet_sendCalls RPC method MUST communicate attribution data through a new capability:

interface DataSuffixCapability {
  dataSuffix: string; // Hex-encoded bytes to append as suffix
}
Wallets implementing this capability MUST append the provided dataSuffix bytes to the transaction calldata. Wallets MAY optionally insert their own attribution code before the application's suffix if they understand this standard.

ERC-4337 User Operation Implementation
For ERC-4337 compliant smart accounts, the implementation differs from normal Ethereum transactions:

Normal Transactions: The attribution suffix is appended to the data field of the top-level Ethereum transaction.

ERC-4337 User Operations: The attribution suffix MUST be appended to the userOp.callData field instead of the transaction-level data field, since smart account transactions are executed through the EntryPoint contract where the actual call data is contained within the user operation structure.

When implementing attribution for smart accounts:

Applications SHOULD append the suffix to userOp.callData when constructing user operations
Parsers MUST examine the callData field of user operations rather than transaction data when processing ERC-4337 transactions
Wallets supporting both EOA and smart account transactions MUST handle suffix appending appropriately based on the account type
This ensures attribution data remains accessible and parseable regardless of whether the transaction originates from an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract account following ERC-4337.

Rationale
Design Decisions
Reverse-order parsing: The suffix format is designed for parsing from the end of calldata backwards, enabling efficient detection of attribution without requiring knowledge of the original calldata length.

schemaId byte: Including a schemaId field enables future extensions and optimizations in minimizing attribution data.

Registry pattern: Using a registry contract allows entities to update their payout addresses and metadata without requiring transaction format changes.

ASCII encoding: Using human-readable ASCII codes improves debuggability and allows for meaningful code names rather than opaque hashes.

ERC-5792 integration: The capability-based approach aligns with ERC-5792's extensible design while providing a clean separation of concerns between applications and wallets.

Alternative Approaches Considered
Customizable registry: While a single global registry is recommended when available for reduced transaction data, the flexible registry approach allows different ecosystems to maintain their own attribution systems.

Fixed-length codes: A fixed-length encoding was considered but rejected to allow for flexible, human-readable identifiers.

ERC-721 dependency: While codes may be implemented as ERC-721 NFTs, reducing strict dependencies makes this proposal more flexible and clarifies the minimal interface truly required for attribution.

Structured ERC-5792 capability: A generic bytes dataSuffix minimizes the effort on wallets to integrate and maintain support for new schemaIds, increasing chances of wide adoption.

Backwards Compatibility
This standard is fully backward compatible with existing transaction formats. Transactions without attribution suffixes continue to function normally, and the presence of attribution data does not affect transaction execution.

Existing applications using informal attribution methods can migrate to this standard while maintaining their current functionality during the transition period.

Security Considerations
Parsing Safety
Parsers MUST validate the suffix format before processing to prevent malformed data from causing errors. Invalid suffixes SHOULD be ignored rather than causing parsing failures.

Registry Trust
The security of attribution data depends on the trustworthiness of the registry contract. Users and applications SHOULD verify the registry implementation and governance before relying on its data.

Data Integrity
Since attribution data is appended to calldata, it could potentially be modified by intermediaries. Applications requiring cryptographic proof of attribution should implement additional signature-based verification mechanisms.

Privacy Considerations
Attribution data is publicly visible on-chain. Applications handling sensitive user information SHOULD NOT include identifying information in attribution codes.

# Base Builder Codes

> Integrate Builder Codes to attribute onchain activity to your app or wallet.

## What are Builder Codes

Base Builder Codes are an ERC-721 NFT collection where unique codes (e.g. “abc123”) are minted to help identify builders onchain.

Each code has associated metadata. Onchain metadata primarily includes a “payout address” where each code declares where potential rewards should be sent to. Offchain metadata includes more details about the app including its name and site.

## Automatic Builder-Code Attribution on Base

Once your app is registered on [Base.dev](http://base.dev/), the Base App will auto-append your Base Builder Code to transactions its users make in your app (e.g. via your mini app, or the Base App's browser). This powers your onchain analytics in [Base.dev](http://base.dev/) and qualifies you for potential future rewards.

## For App Developers

<Note>
  Mini Apps in the Base app will have their builder codes auto-appended to their transactions.
  Be sure to [register for Base.dev](https://base.dev/)
</Note>

Integrating Builder Codes requires appending a suffix—provided by Base—to your transaction data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Builder Code">
    When you register on **base.dev**, you will receive a **Builder Code**. This is a random string (e.g., `k3p9da`) that you will use to generate your attribution suffix.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Append the Suffix to Transactions">
    The recommended way to attach your suffix is using `wallet_sendCalls` (ERC-5792). This passes the suffix through a capability, allowing the wallet to handle the attachment automatically for both EOA and Smart Account (ERC-4337) users.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Wagmi (Recommended)">
        Use the `useSendCalls` hook from Wagmi's features to pass the `dataSuffix` capability.

        ```typescript lines highlight={14-16} theme={null}
        import { useSendCalls } from 'wagmi'
        import { Attribution } from 'ox/erc8021'

        // Your builder code provided by base.dev
        const builderCode = "abcd1234" 
        const dataSuffix = Attribution.toDataSuffix({
            codes: [builderCode]
        })

        function SendTx() {
          const { sendCalls } = useSendCalls()

          async function submit() {
            await sendCalls({
              calls: [
                {
                  to: "0xYourContract",
                  data: "0xYourCalldata"
                }
              ],
              capabilities: {
                dataSuffix: dataSuffix
              }
            })
          }

          return <button onClick={submit}>Send</button>
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Viem">
        If you are using Viem directly, pass the `dataSuffix` in the `capabilities` object.

        ```typescript lines highlight={11-13} theme={null}
        import { walletClient } from './client'
        import { Attribution } from 'ox/erc8021'

        // Your builder code provided by base.dev
        const builderCode = "abcd1234" 
        const dataSuffix = Attribution.toDataSuffix({
            codes: [builderCode]
        })

        await walletClient.sendCalls({
          calls: [
            {
              to: "0xYourContract",
              data: "0xYourCalldata"
            }

          capabilities: {
            dataSuffix: dataSuffix
          }
        })
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Legacy (writeContract)">
        If you are restricted to `writeContract` (EOA only), you must manually append the suffix to the calldata. This is **not recommended** as it does not support Smart Accounts automatically.

        ```typescript lines highlight={15} theme={null}
        import { encodeFunctionData } from 'viem'
        import { Attribution } from 'ox/erc8021'

        // Your builder code provided by base.dev
        const builderCode = "abcd1234" 
        const dataSuffix = Attribution.toDataSuffix({
            codes: [builderCode]
        })

        // 1. Encode your function call
        const encoded = encodeFunctionData({
          abi,
          functionName: "yourFn",
          args: [a, b, c],
        })

        // 2. Manually append the suffix (stripping the '0x' prefix from the suffix)
        const dataWithSuffix = encoded + dataSuffix.slice(2)

        // 3. Send the transaction
        await sendTransaction({
          to: "0xYourContract",
          data: dataWithSuffix,
        })
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you have added the suffix, your app is fully ERC-8021 compliant.

## For Wallet Developers

Wallet providers need to support the `dataSuffix` capability to enable attribution. This involves accepting the capability and appending the suffix to the calldata before signing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Support the dataSuffix Capability">
    Your wallet should accept a `dataSuffix` string in the `capabilities` object of `wallet_sendCalls`.

    ```typescript lines theme={null}
    interface DataSuffixCapability {
      dataSuffix: string; // hex-encoded bytes provided by the app
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Append Suffix to Calldata">
    When constructing the transaction or User Operation, extract the `dataSuffix` and append it to the calldata.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="EOA Transactions">
        Append to `tx.data`.

        ```typescript lines theme={null}
        // Minimal example for EOA
        function applySuffixToEOA(tx, capabilities) {
          const suffix = capabilities.find(c => c.dataSuffix)?.dataSuffix
          if (!suffix) return tx

          return {
            ...tx,
            // Append suffix bytes (remove 0x prefix from suffix if tx.data has it)
            data: tx.data + suffix.slice(2) 
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="ERC-4337 User Operations">
        Append to `userOp.callData` (not the transaction-level calldata).

        ```typescript lines theme={null}
        // Minimal example for ERC-4337
        function applySuffixToUserOp(userOp, capabilities) {
          const suffix = capabilities.find(c => c.dataSuffix)?.dataSuffix
          if (!suffix) return userOp

          return {
            ...userOp,
            // Append suffix bytes to the UserOp callData
            callData: userOp.callData + suffix.slice(2)
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="(Optional) Add Wallet Attribution">
    Wallets may also include their own attribution code (their own ERC-8021 suffix) by simply prepending the wallet’s own suffix before the app’s.

    * **No interaction required with apps:** The wallet handles this independently.
    * **Multi-code support:** ERC-8021 natively supports multiple attribution codes.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript  theme={null}
    finalSuffix = walletSuffix + appSuffix
    ```

    This ensures both the app and the wallet receive onchain attribution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## For Base-Solana Bridge Developers

<Warning>
  Onchain Builder codes are currently still not live on mainnet.
</Warning>

Builder codes work with the [Base-Solana bridge](/base-chain/quickstart/base-solana-bridge) via the `hookData` mechanism. Currently available for **Solana → Base** flows only.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Builder Code">
    When you register on base.dev, you will receive a Builder Code. This is a random string (e.g., k3p9da) that you will use to generate your attribution suffix.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build hookData">
    ABI-encode the user address, your code, and fee:

    ```solidity  theme={null}
    bytes memory hookData = abi.encode(
      0xUSER,           // destination address on Base (NOT the Twin)
      0xBUILDER_CODE,   // your bytes32 code
      100               // feeBps (100 = 1%)
    );
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach to Bridge Message">
    Set `to = BRIDGE_CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS` and attach a call to `Flywheel.send`.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Simple Bridge">
        For a bridge with no follow-up call:

        ```
        to:     <BRIDGE_CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS>
        amount: 100
        call:
          ty:    Call
          to:    <FLYWHEEL_ADDRESS>
          value: 0
          data:  abi.encodeWithSelector(
                   Flywheel.send.selector,
                   <BRIDGE_CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS>,
                   <wSOL_ADDRESS>,
                   hookData
                 )
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Bridge + Follow-Up Call">
        To chain additional calls, use `DelegateCall` with `Multicall`:

        ```solidity  theme={null}
        Call[] memory calls = new Call[](2);

        // 1) Flywheel attribution (must be first)
        calls[0] = Call({
          to:    <FLYWHEEL_ADDRESS>,
          value: 0,
          data:  abi.encodeWithSelector(
                   Flywheel.send.selector,
                   <BRIDGE_CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS>,
                   <wSOL_ADDRESS>, // 0x311935Cd80B76769bF2ecC9D8Ab7635b2139cf82 on Base Mainnet
                   hookData
                 )
        });

        // 2) Your follow-up call
        calls[1] = Call({
          to:    <YOUR_CONTRACT>,
          value: 0,
          data:  abi.encodeWithSelector(YourContract.yourFunction.selector)
        });
        ```

        Then set the bridge call to:

        ```
        call:
          ty:    DelegateCall
          to:    <MULTICALL_ADDRESS> // 0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11 on Base Mainnet
          data:  abi.encodeWithSelector(Multicall.multicall.selector, calls)
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Tip>
    Set `"noindex": true` for development or staging environments to prevent search indexing.
  </Tip>
</Panel>

## Implementation

1. Create the manifest file in your project at `/public/.well-known/farcaster.json`. It needs to be accessible at `https://your-domain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json`
2. Update the [required](#accountassociation) and [optional](#display-information) fields in the `miniapp` object
3. Ensure all changes are live so that the Manifest file is available at your app's url
4. Navigate to the Base Build [Account association tool](https://www.base.dev/preview?tab=account)
5. Paste your domain in the App URL field (ex: sample-url.vercel.app) and click "Submit"
6. Click on the "Verify" button that appears and sign the manifest with your wallet to generate the `accountAssociation` fields
7. Copy the generated `accountAssociation` fields (header, payload, and signature) and paste them into your manifest file, replacing the empty values in the `accountAssociation` object

<Warning>
  Changes to the manifest take effect when you redeploy your Mini App and repost it. The platform re-indexes the updated configuration and applies changes to search, discovery, and embed rendering.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Use the [Mini App Assets Generator](https://www.miniappassets.com/) to generate properly formatted icons, splash screens, and images that meet the requirements for both Base App and Farcaster mini apps.

#### Denial of Service and Source Code Exposure in React Server Components  
#### December 11, 2025 by The React Team  
####   
#### Security researchers have found and disclosed two additional vulnerabilities in React Server Components while attempting to exploit the patches in last week’s critical vulnerability.  
####   
#### These new vulnerabilities do not allow for Remote Code Execution. The patch for React2Shell remains effective at mitigating the Remote Code Execution exploit.  
####   
#### The new vulnerabilities are disclosed as:  
####   
#### Denial of Service - High Severity: CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-67779 (CVSS 7.5)  
#### Source Code Exposure - Medium Severity: CVE-2025-55183 (CVSS 5.3)  
#### We recommend upgrading immediately due to the severity of the newly disclosed vulnerabilities.  
####   
#### Note  
#### The patches published earlier are vulnerable.   
#### If you already updated for the Critical Security Vulnerability last week, you will need to update again.  
####   
#### If you updated to 19.0.2, 19.1.3, and 19.2.2, these are incomplete and you will need to update again.  
####   
#### Please see the instructions in the previous post for upgrade steps.  
####   
#### Further details of these vulnerabilities will be provided after the rollout of the fixes are complete.  
####   
#### Immediate Action Required   
#### These vulnerabilities are present in the same packages and versions as CVE-2025-55182.  
####   
#### This includes versions 19.0.0, 19.0.1, 19.0.2, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.1.2, 19.1.2, 19.2.0, 19.2.1 and 19.2.2 of:  
####   
#### react-server-dom-webpack  
#### react-server-dom-parcel  
#### react-server-dom-turbopack  
#### Fixes were backported to versions 19.0.3, 19.1.4, and 19.2.3. If you are using any of the above packages please upgrade to any of the fixed versions immediately.  
####   
#### As before, if your app’s React code does not use a server, your app is not affected by these vulnerabilities. If your app does not use a framework, bundler, or bundler plugin that supports React Server Components, your app is not affected by these vulnerabilities.  
####   
#### Note  
#### It’s common for critical CVEs to uncover follow‑up vulnerabilities.   
#### When a critical vulnerability is disclosed, researchers scrutinize adjacent code paths looking for variant exploit techniques to test whether the initial mitigation can be bypassed.  
####   
#### This pattern shows up across the industry, not just in JavaScript. For example, after Log4Shell, additional CVEs (1, 2) were reported as the community probed the original fix.  
####   
#### Additional disclosures can be frustrating, but they are generally a sign of a healthy response cycle.  
####   
#### Affected frameworks and bundlers   
#### Some React frameworks and bundlers depended on, had peer dependencies for, or included the vulnerable React packages. The following React frameworks & bundlers are affected: next, react-router, waku, @parcel/rsc, @vite/rsc-plugin, and rwsdk.  
####   
#### Please see the instructions in the previous post for upgrade steps.  
####   
#### Hosting Provider Mitigations   
#### As before, we have worked with a number of hosting providers to apply temporary mitigations.  
####   
#### You should not depend on these to secure your app, and still update immediately.  
####   
#### React Native   
#### For React Native users not using a monorepo or react-dom, your react version should be pinned in your package.json, and there are no additional steps needed.  
####   
#### If you are using React Native in a monorepo, you should update only the impacted packages if they are installed:  
####   
#### react-server-dom-webpack  
#### react-server-dom-parcel  
#### react-server-dom-turbopack  
#### This is required to mitigate the security advisories, but you do not need to update react and react-dom so this will not cause the version mismatch error in React Native.  
####   
#### See this issue for more information.  
####   
#### High Severity: Denial of Service   
#### CVEs: CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-67779  
#### Base Score: 7.5 (High)  
####   
#### Security researchers have discovered that a malicious HTTP request can be crafted and sent to any Server Functions endpoint that, when deserialized by React, can cause an infinite loop that hangs the server process and consumes CPU. Even if your app does not implement any React Server Function endpoints it may still be vulnerable if your app supports React Server Components.  
####   
#### This creates a vulnerability vector where an attacker may be able to deny users from accessing the product, and potentially have a  performance impact on the server environment.

#### The original fix addressing the DoS in CVE-2025-55184 was incomplete.  
####   
#### This left versions 19.0.2, 19.1.3, 19.2.2 vulnerable. Versions 19.0.3, 19.1.4, 19.2.3 are safe.

#### Medium Severity: Source Code Exposure   
#### CVE: CVE-2025-55183  
#### Base Score: 5.3 (Medium)  
####   
#### A security researcher has discovered that a malicious HTTP request sent to a vulnerable Server Function may unsafely return the source code of any Server Function. Exploitation requires the existence of a Server Function which explicitly or implicitly exposes a stringified argument:  
####   
#### 'use server';  
####   
#### export async function serverFunction(name) {  
####   const conn = db.createConnection('SECRET KEY');  
####   const user = await conn.createUser(name); // implicitly stringified, leaked in db  
####   
####   return {  
####    id: user.id,  
####    message: `Hello, ${name}!` // explicitly stringified, leaked in reply  
####   }}  
#### An attacker may be able to leak the following:  
####   
#### 0:{"a":"$@1","f":"","b":"Wy43RxUKdxmr5iuBzJ1pN"}  
#### 1:{"id":"tva1sfodwq","message":"Hello, async function(a){console.log(\"serverFunction\");let b=i.createConnection(\"SECRET KEY\");return{id:(await b.createUser(a)).id,message:`Hello, ${a}!`}}!"}  
#### The patches published today prevent stringifying the Server Function source code.  
####   
#### Note  
#### Only secrets in source code may be exposed.   
#### Secrets hardcoded in source code may be exposed, but runtime secrets such as process.env.SECRET are not affected.  
####   
#### The scope of the exposed code is limited to the code inside the Server Function, which may include other functions depending on the amount of inlining your bundler provides.  
####   
#### Always verify against production bundles.

#### Abstract  
#### This ERC defines a standardized method for attributing transactions to applications, wallets, and other entities through structured data suffixes appended to transaction calldata. The standard enables interoperable attribution tracking, supports multiple entity attribution per transaction, and provides a mechanism for reward distribution through registered payout addresses.  
####   
#### Motivation  
#### Currently, applications informally append "data suffixes" to transactions to indicate their origin, typically using the first bytes of a hash representing the application name. For example, Coinbase adds keccak256("CoinbaseSmartWallet") to transactions from keys.coinbase.com, and apps like Zora and OpenSea employ similar approaches.  
####   
#### This ad-hoc approach presents several limitations:  
####   
#### Non-interoperable attribution: Each application uses custom suffix formats, requiring explicit checks for specific patterns to detect attributions  
#### Opaque identification: Hash-based suffixes obscure the actual application identity, making attribution analysis difficult  
#### Reward distribution challenges: Even when an application is identified, there's no standardized way to determine where to send rewards  
#### Limited multi-entity support: No clear mechanism for attributing transactions to multiple entities (e.g., both application and wallet)  
#### Lack of extensibility: No standardized way to query additional metadata about attributed entities  
#### This standard addresses these issues by providing a structured, extensible format for transaction attribution that supports multiple entities, reward distribution, and metadata discovery.  
####   
#### Specification  
#### The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.  
####   
#### Data Suffix Schema  
#### This standard defines a structured data suffix format appended to transaction calldata. The suffix consists of the following components (ordered from end of calldata backwards):  
####   
#### ercSuffix (16 bytes): A special identifier value indicating use of this standard ("8021" repeated)  
#### schemaId (1 byte): Schema ID number that declares the schema of proceeding bytes with space for forwards compatibility  
#### schemaData (variable bytes): Data to be parsed according to schemaId  
#### A schemaId MUST have an associated ERC to be considered valid.  
####   
#### Multi-Attribution Schemas  
#### Our first schemas enable attributing multiple entities in a single transaction.  
####   
#### Entities are identified by a unique "code" which is a string that follows 7-bit ASCII encoding. A code MUST NOT contain commas (0x2C) as this is reserved as a delimitter for attributing multiple codes.  
####   
#### Codes MUST also be registered in a Code Regsitry smart contract (interface defined in later section). Chains are encouraged to provide canonical code registries which MAY be defined in this or future ERCs.  
####   
#### Schema ID 0 defines the following bytes and assumes chain's canonical Code Registry:  
####   
#### codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters  
#### codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter  
#### Schema ID 1 builds on top of 0, but also defines a custom Code Registry chain and address  
####   
#### codesLength (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters  
#### codes (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (0x2C) as delimiter  
#### codeRegistryChainIdLength (1 byte): Length of the chain id hosting the custom Code Registry  
#### codeRegistryChainId (variable bytes): Chain id hosting the custom Code Registry  
#### codeRegistryAddress (20 bytes): Address of a smart contract implementing ICodeRegistry  
#### Custom Code Registries can be referenced across chains for ease of connecting identity for multi-chain apps.  
####   
#### Examples  
#### The complete suffix format is:  
####   
#### {txData}{schemaData}{schemaId}{ercSuffix}  
#### Single entity attribution with canonical registry:  
####   
#### {txData}{"baseapp"}{7}{0}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}  
#### Multiple entity attribution with custom registry:  
####   
#### {txData}{0xCodeRegistry}{8453}{2}{"baseapp,morpho"}{14}{1}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}  
#### Parsing Algorithm  
#### Offchain parsers SHOULD implement the following algorithm:  
####   
#### Extract the last TBD bytes as ercSuffix and verify it matches the standard identifier  
#### Extract the previous byte as schemaId  
#### If schemaId is 0: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Implicitly set codeRegistryAddress as the registry defined by the host chain d. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes e. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on host chain  
#### If schemaId is 1: a. Extract the previous byte as codesLength b. Extract the previous codesLength bytes as codes c. Extract the previous byte as codeRegistryChainIdLength d. Extract the previous codeRegistryChainIdLength bytes as codeRegistryChainId e. Extract the previous 20 bytes as codeRegistryAddress f. Parse codes using 0x2C (comma) as delimiter between codes g. Query code-related data from codeRegistryAddress on chain with id codeRegistryChainId  
#### Else schemaId does not match, parsing SHOULD terminate (unknown schemaId)  
#### Code Registry Interface  
#### A Code Registry MUST implement the following interface:  
####   
#### interface ICodeRegistry {  
####     /// @notice Fetch a code's address to payout incentives  
####     /// @param code The code to query  
####     /// @return The address to receive rewards for this code  
####     function payoutAddress(string memory code) external view returns (address);  
####       
####     /// @notice Fetch a code's URI to fetch for additional metadata  
####     /// @param code The code to query    
####     /// @return The URI pointing to metadata about this code  
####     function codeURI(string memory code) external view returns (string memory);  
####       
####     /// @notice Check if a code is valid format (characters, length, etc)  
####     /// @dev MUST return false if code is empty string  
####     /// @param code The code to query  
####     /// @return True if the code is valid, false otherwise  
####     function isValidCode(string memory code) external view returns (bool);  
####       
####     /// @notice Check if a code is registered  
####     /// @param code The code to query  
####     /// @return True if the code is registered, false otherwise  
####     function isRegistered(string memory code) external view returns (bool);  
#### }  
#### Code Regsitry Canonical Addresses  
#### Chain ID	Code Registry  
#### 8453	TBD  
#### 84532	TBD  
#### Code Metadata  
#### Querying CodeRegistry.codeURI(code) returns a string uri to fetch actual metadata, following from NFT patterns. The returned metadata SHOULD include these fields:  
####   
#### type CodeMetadata = {  
####     app: {  
####       name: string  
####       url: string  
####     }  
#### }  
#### Future ERCs can extend this schema.  
####   
#### ERC-5792 Integration  
#### Applications using ERC-5792's wallet_sendCalls RPC method MUST communicate attribution data through a new capability:  
####   
#### interface DataSuffixCapability {  
####   dataSuffix: string; // Hex-encoded bytes to append as suffix  
#### }  
#### Wallets implementing this capability MUST append the provided dataSuffix bytes to the transaction calldata. Wallets MAY optionally insert their own attribution code before the application's suffix if they understand this standard.  
####   
#### ERC-4337 User Operation Implementation  
#### For ERC-4337 compliant smart accounts, the implementation differs from normal Ethereum transactions:  
####   
#### Normal Transactions: The attribution suffix is appended to the data field of the top-level Ethereum transaction.  
####   
#### ERC-4337 User Operations: The attribution suffix MUST be appended to the userOp.callData field instead of the transaction-level data field, since smart account transactions are executed through the EntryPoint contract where the actual call data is contained within the user operation structure.  
####   
#### When implementing attribution for smart accounts:  
####   
#### Applications SHOULD append the suffix to userOp.callData when constructing user operations  
#### Parsers MUST examine the callData field of user operations rather than transaction data when processing ERC-4337 transactions  
#### Wallets supporting both EOA and smart account transactions MUST handle suffix appending appropriately based on the account type  
#### This ensures attribution data remains accessible and parseable regardless of whether the transaction originates from an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract account following ERC-4337.  
####   
#### Rationale  
#### Design Decisions  
#### Reverse-order parsing: The suffix format is designed for parsing from the end of calldata backwards, enabling efficient detection of attribution without requiring knowledge of the original calldata length.  
####   
#### schemaId byte: Including a schemaId field enables future extensions and optimizations in minimizing attribution data.  
####   
#### Registry pattern: Using a registry contract allows entities to update their payout addresses and metadata without requiring transaction format changes.  
####   
#### ASCII encoding: Using human-readable ASCII codes improves debuggability and allows for meaningful code names rather than opaque hashes.  
####   
#### ERC-5792 integration: The capability-based approach aligns with ERC-5792's extensible design while providing a clean separation of concerns between applications and wallets.  
####   
#### Alternative Approaches Considered  
#### Customizable registry: While a single global registry is recommended when available for reduced transaction data, the flexible registry approach allows different ecosystems to maintain their own attribution systems.  
####   
#### Fixed-length codes: A fixed-length encoding was considered but rejected to allow for flexible, human-readable identifiers.  
####   
#### ERC-721 dependency: While codes may be implemented as ERC-721 NFTs, reducing strict dependencies makes this proposal more flexible and clarifies the minimal interface truly required for attribution.  
####   
#### Structured ERC-5792 capability: A generic bytes dataSuffix minimizes the effort on wallets to integrate and maintain support for new schemaIds, increasing chances of wide adoption.  
####   
#### Backwards Compatibility  
#### This standard is fully backward compatible with existing transaction formats. Transactions without attribution suffixes continue to function normally, and the presence of attribution data does not affect transaction execution.  
####   
#### Existing applications using informal attribution methods can migrate to this standard while maintaining their current functionality during the transition period.  
####   
#### Security Considerations  
#### Parsing Safety  
#### Parsers MUST validate the suffix format before processing to prevent malformed data from causing errors. Invalid suffixes SHOULD be ignored rather than causing parsing failures.  
####   
#### Registry Trust  
#### The security of attribution data depends on the trustworthiness of the registry contract. Users and applications SHOULD verify the registry implementation and governance before relying on its data.  
####   
#### Data Integrity  
#### Since attribution data is appended to calldata, it could potentially be modified by intermediaries. Applications requiring cryptographic proof of attribution should implement additional signature-based verification mechanisms.  
####   
#### Privacy Considerations  
#### Attribution data is publicly visible on-chain. Applications handling sensitive user information SHOULD NOT include identifying information in attribution codes.  
####

#### # Base Builder Codes  
####   
#### > Integrate Builder Codes to attribute onchain activity to your app or wallet.  
####   
#### ## What are Builder Codes  
####   
#### Base Builder Codes are an ERC-721 NFT collection where unique codes (e.g. “abc123”) are minted to help identify builders onchain.  
####   
#### Each code has associated metadata. Onchain metadata primarily includes a “payout address” where each code declares where potential rewards should be sent to. Offchain metadata includes more details about the app including its name and site.  
####   
#### ## Automatic Builder-Code Attribution on Base  
####   
#### Once your app is registered on [Base.dev](http://base.dev/), the Base App will auto-append your Base Builder Code to transactions its users make in your app (e.g. via your mini app, or the Base App's browser). This powers your onchain analytics in [Base.dev](http://base.dev/) and qualifies you for potential future rewards.  
####   
#### ## For App Developers  
####   
#### <Note>  
####   Mini Apps in the Base app will have their builder codes auto-appended to their transactions.  
####   Be sure to [register for Base.dev](https://base.dev/)  
#### </Note>  
####   
#### Integrating Builder Codes requires appending a suffix—provided by Base—to your transaction data.  
####   
#### <Steps>  
####   <Step title="Get your Builder Code">  
####     When you register on **base.dev**, you will receive a **Builder Code**. This is a random string (e.g., `k3p9da`) that you will use to generate your attribution suffix.  
####   </Step>  
####   
####   <Step title="Append the Suffix to Transactions">  
####     The recommended way to attach your suffix is using `wallet_sendCalls` (ERC-5792). This passes the suffix through a capability, allowing the wallet to handle the attachment automatically for both EOA and Smart Account (ERC-4337) users.  
####   
####     <Tabs>  
####       <Tab title="Wagmi (Recommended)">

####   <Step title="(Optional) Add Wallet Attribution">  
####     Wallets may also include their own attribution code (their own ERC-8021 suffix) by simply prepending the wallet’s own suffix before the app’s.  
####   
####     * **No interaction required with apps:** The wallet handles this independently.  
####     * **Multi-code support:** ERC-8021 natively supports multiple attribution codes.  
####   
####     **Example:**  
####   
####     ```typescript  theme={null}  
####     finalSuffix = walletSuffix + appSuffix  
####     ```  
####   
####     This ensures both the app and the wallet receive onchain attribution.

#### ## For Base-Solana Bridge Developers  
####   
#### <Warning>  
####   Onchain Builder codes are currently still not live on mainnet.  
#### </Warning>  
####   
#### Builder codes work with the [Base-Solana bridge](/base-chain/quickstart/base-solana-bridge) via the `hookData` mechanism. Currently available for **Solana → Base** flows only.  
####   
#### <Steps>  
####   <Step title="Get your Builder Code">  
####     When you register on base.dev, you will receive a Builder Code. This is a random string (e.g., k3p9da) that you will use to generate your attribution suffix.  
####   </Step>  
####   
####   <Step title="Build hookData">  
####     ABI-encode the user address, your code, and fee:  
####   
####     ```solidity  theme={null}  
####     bytes memory hookData = abi.encode(  
####       0xUSER,           // destination address on Base (NOT the Twin)  
####       0xBUILDER_CODE,   // your bytes32 code  
####       100               // feeBps (100 = 1%)  
####     );  
####     ```  
####   </Step>  
####

####   
####   <Tip>  
####     Set `"noindex": true` for development or staging environments to prevent search indexing.  
####   </Tip>  
#### </Panel>  
####   
#### ## Implementation  
####   
#### 1. Create the manifest file in your project at `/public/.well-known/farcaster.json`. It needs to be accessible at `https://your-domain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json`  
#### 2. Update the [required](#accountassociation) and [optional](#display-information) fields in the `miniapp` object  
#### 3. Ensure all changes are live so that the Manifest file is available at your app's url  
#### 4. Navigate to the Base Build [Account association tool](https://www.base.dev/preview?tab=account)  
#### 5. Paste your domain in the App URL field (ex: sample-url.vercel.app) and click "Submit"  
#### 6. Click on the "Verify" button that appears and sign the manifest with your wallet to generate the `accountAssociation` fields  
#### 7. Copy the generated `accountAssociation` fields (header, payload, and signature) and paste them into your manifest file, replacing the empty values in the `accountAssociation` object  
####   
#### <Warning>  
####   Changes to the manifest take effect when you redeploy your Mini App and repost it. The platform re-indexes the updated configuration and applies changes to search, discovery, and embed rendering.  
#### </Warning>  
####   
#### <Tip>  
####   Use the [Mini App Assets Generator](https://www.miniappassets.com/) to generate properly formatted icons, splash screens, and images that meet the requirements for both Base App and Farcaster mini apps.  
#### </Tip>
